\textbf{Affine Parameter-Dependent Lyapunov Stability Analysis of Electronic Power Steering Systems} \\
\end{center}

The application of electronic power steering (EPS) is mandatory for modern vehicles. Due to the increasing application of driver assistance and autonomous functions (ADAS), the steering system is a safety-critical human-machine interface. It is thus crucial to maintain the system in a stable region during operation. In order to achieve this goal, qualitative measures are needed a priori to support controller synthesis. By their nature, EPS systems have a couple of nonlinearities. However, they can be approximated by linear parameter-varying (LPV) models where the scheduling variables capture the nonlinear effects. Based on the LPV model, a stabilizing full-state feedback controller can be designed. The design can be effectively supported by the aforementioned qualitative measures of regions of stability in the parameter space.

This project work aims at quantifying the parameter-varying stability region of EPS for further ADAS interface development. The tasks of the student will be:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Literature study of affine LPV models and their quadratic stability in general;
	\item Development of an affine LPV model for the EPAS system based on the literature;
	\item Development of a set of affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions for the EPAS system;
	\item Analysis of the quadratic stability regions of the EPAS system; 
\end{enumerate}

For the completion of this project work the Thyssenkrupp Component Technology Hungary Kft. assures the supervisor and the necessary equipment.
