I, \emph{\vikszerzoVezeteknev{} \vikszerzoKeresztnev}, the undersigned, hereby declare that the present \vikdoktipus{} work has been prepared by myself and without any unauthorized help or assistance. Only the specified sources (references, tools, etc.) were used. All parts taken from other sources word by word, or after rephrasing but with identical meaning, were unambiguously identified with explicit reference to the sources utilized.

I authorize the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics to publish the principal data of the thesis work (author's name, title, abstracts in English and in a second language, year of preparation, supervisor's name, etc.) in a searchable, public, electronic and online database and to publish the full text of the thesis work on the internal network of the university (this may include access by authenticated outside users). I declare that the submitted hard-copy of the thesis work and its electronic version are identical.
