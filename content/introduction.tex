\chapter{\bevezetes}

The introduction contains the analysis of the diploma plan announcement, its historical antecedents, the justification of the task (description of the motivation), the solutions so far and, in light of this, a summary of the student's solution.

As usual, the introduction ends with the structure of the diploma plan, i.e. with a brief description of what each chapter deals with.
